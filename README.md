8. User Satisfaction and Business Growth. Well-engineered software enhances user experience, leading to higher customer satisfaction and business success.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 - NATO Conference)
In 1968, NATO held a conference in Germany where the term software engineering was first introduced. The conference addressed the software crisis, where large projects were failing due to poor management, lack of structured methodologies, and unreliable software.
Impact: This milestone led to the formalization of software engineering as a discipline, emphasizing structured programming, documentation, and quality control.

2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s - 1980s)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) emerged as a solution to complex software development. Early OOP languages like Simula (1960s) and Smalltalk (1970s) paved the way for mainstream adoption with C++ (1983) and later Java (1995).
Impact: OOP introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making software more modular, reusable, and scalable.

3. The Agile Manifesto (2001 - Revolutionizing Development Methodologies)
In response to rigid and slow traditional software development approaches like the Waterfall model, 17 software experts published the Agile Manifesto in 2001. Agile promotes iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.
Impact: Agile transformed software engineering, leading to frameworks like Scrum and Kanban, enabling faster delivery and better responsiveness to changing requirements.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Initiation: Define project goals and objectives, conduct feasibiity studies,, identify stakeholders and develop project charter.
2. Planning: Develop project management plan, define constraints and plan resources.
3. Execution: Assign tasks, implement project plans, manage teams and ensure quality assurance processes are followed.
4. Monitoring and Controlling: Track project progress, perform quality control, manage changes to constraints and report performance to stakeholder.
5. Closure: Finalize all project activities, obtain formal acceptance, release project resources and document lessons learnt and archive project documents.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology applies a linear and sequential approach while Agile methodology applies an iterative and incremental approach.
Waterfall methodology: Appropriate where the stakeholders know the features and functions that the software should be able to do.
Agile methodology: Approriate where the stakeholders do not know the features and functions that the software should be able to do.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
